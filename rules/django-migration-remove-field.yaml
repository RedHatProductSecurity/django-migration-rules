    message: A field should only be removed in two steps, the first being a
      state-only removal and the second being an SQL-only removal, each step
      in a different version of the application to guarantee backwards compatibility.
      If the field has a NOT NULL constraint, it should be dropped prior to the
      state removal or alternatively, an SQL default value provided.
